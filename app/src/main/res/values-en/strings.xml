    <!-- Strings used for welcome fragment-->
    <string name="welcome">Welcome</string>
    <string name="welcomeExplanation">Thank you for downloading <b>KeyCip</b>. You are closer to having more control over the information you upload to different services on the internet.</string>
    <string name="continueButton">Continue</string>

    <!-- Strings used for whatIs fragment-->
    <string name="whatIS">What does KeyCip?</string>
    <string name="whatIsExplanation"><b>KeyCip</b> is an application that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text, photographs, videos, documents and other files. To do this, it uses the <b>RSA (mainly)</b> and <b>AES</b> encryption algorithms (generating and managing the sets of keys).</string>
    <string name="explainButton">Need help?</string>
    <string name="genKeyButton">I am already familiar with encryption algorithms.</string>

    <!-- Strings used for concept fragments-->
    <!-- whatIsCipher-->
    <string name="whatIsCipher">What does encryption mean?</string>
    <string name="whatIsCipherExplanation"><b>Encrypting</b> a text, photograph, video or document means hiding its content so that only a specific person can know that information. This ensures that when the encrypted text, photograph, video or document is sent, its content remains confidential.</string>

    <!-- whatIsDecipher-->
    <string name="whatIsDecipher">What does it mean to decrypt?</string>
    <string name="whatIsDecipherExplanation"><b>Decrypting</b> a text, photograph, video or document is the reverse of encrypting. In other words, the original content is returned to the encrypted file by a certain process.</string>

    <!-- whatIsSign-->
    <string name="whatIsSign">What does it mean to sign?</string>
    <string name="whatIsSignExplanation"><b>Signing</b> a text, photograph, video or document is similar to signing a letter. The content of the text or file is not changed or hidden but allows the recipient to confirm that the person who sent it is indeed the person he or she claims to be.</string>

    <!-- signCipher-->
    <string name="signCipher">Is it possible to sign and encrypt at the same time?</string>
    <string name="signCipherExplanation">By signing and encrypting, you keep the content of what you send confidential, while giving the recipient the opportunity to verify your identity.</string>

    <!-- whatIsAlgorithm-->
    <string name="whatIsAlgorithm">What is an encryption algorithm?</string>
    <string name="whatIsAlgorithmExplanation">An <b>encryption algorithm</b> is the set of steps that must be carried out to encrypt, decrypt or sign any text or file. In our case, <b>RSA</b> is used.</string>

    <!-- whatIsPublicKey-->
    <string name="whatIsPublicKey">What is a public key?</string>
    <string name="whatIsPublicKeyExplanation">This is the key that you will share with your contacts. When one of them wants to send you an encrypted text or file so that only you can know the actual content, they will use this key to encrypt it.</string>

    <!-- whatIsPrivateKey-->
    <string name="whatIsPrivateKey">What is a private key?</string>
    <string name="whatIsPrivateKeyExplanation">With this key, you will decrypt the encrypted messages sent to you.</string>

    <!-- location-->
    <string name="location">Where are these keys stored?</string>
    <string name="locationExplanation">Because these are personal keys, they will never leave your phone, nor do we have access to them (in fact, the application does not connect to the internet).</string>

    <!-- complicated-->
    <string name="complicated">Too complicated?</string>
    <string name="complicatedExplanation">Don\'t worry, the application is simple and will guide you through the whole process of <b>encrypting</b>, <b>decrypting</b> and <b>signing</b>. In addition, you can access this tutorial whenever you want to review concepts.</string>

    <!-- Strings used for gen Key fragment-->

    <string name="fingerprintExplanatioon">It has been detected that you have alternative authentication methods (such as fingerprint). Do you want to use them as well?</string>
    <string name="errorInsertedPin">Remember that the PIN inserted must be five digits long.</string>
    <string name="errorInsertedPinEmpty">No PIN has been entered</string>
    <string name="errorInsertedPinDifferent">PIN does not match</string>
